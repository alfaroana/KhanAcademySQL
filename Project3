//**Project: App Impersonator
Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.**//


/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

CREATE TABLE twitter (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, username TEXT, location TEXT, date TEXT, tweet TEXT);

INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("bobbyhill12", "USA", "11-11-2020", "Hey everyone!"); 
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("Spongebob1999", "Bikini Bottom", "11-12-2020", "I'm Ready!");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("FinnAndJake20", "Land of ooo", "11-15-2020", "MATHEMATICAL!");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("PanPanChan", "USA", "12-12-2020", "Listening to Kpop!");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("PatrickStar1999", "Bikini Bottom", "12-20-2020", "Who ate my chocolate?!?!");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("bobbyhill12", "USA", "01-11-2021", "Good thing winter is not that cold in texas!"); 
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("Spongebob1999", "Bikini Bottom", "01-13-2021", "Nervous about my driver's license test today.");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("FinnAndJake20", "Land of ooo", "01-15-2021", "Its adventuretime!!!");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("PanPanChan", "USA", "02-10-2021", "Japan is sooo cool!");
INSERT INTO twitter (username, location, date, tweet) VALUES ("PatrickStar1999", "Bikini Bottom", "02-20-2021", "I can't wait until spongebob gets home from work.");

SELECT * FROM twitter;

UPDATE twitter SET location ="Japan" WHERE username="PanPanChan";

/*Patrick Star realized he ate his own chocolate, after feeling embarassed for acting out, he decides to delete his tweet */
